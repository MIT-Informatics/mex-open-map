\item Lower chamber of Congress elected every 3 years

  \item SMD only until 1961
  \item Mixed system since 1979: 300 SMD + 200 PR seats

Hamilton method used:

\begin{itemize}
\item The quota (or price of a seat) is $Q = \frac{\text{nation's population}}{300}$

\item First allocation is $\frac{\text{state's population}}{Q}$, rounded down

\item Every state gets 2 seats min

\item Unallocated seats, if any, awarded to states with largest fractional remainders

\item ... but no obligation to redistrict as soon as available
