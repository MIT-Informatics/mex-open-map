According to Mackie and Rose (p.228),

 "The 1946 election was conducted under a large district system
  using the limited vote system returning from four to 14 representatives.
  Each elector was allowed to cast two votes or three votes in constituencies
  returning more than 11 representatives.  In 1946 a return was made to the
  medium district system with constituencies returning from three to five
  members each and electors using the single non-transferable vote.  Since
  1953 the Amami-Oshima district has returned a single representative."

   (The Passin article is the one suggesting the 1946 election
    had min-max representation of 1 and 14, instead of the 4 and 14
    cited here.)
