title: "Proposal Analysis"

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Description: This notebook file was created by A. Trelles on 12/28/19 as part of the Strategy Paper. 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

#General Description:
This analysis is used as a reference to write the code for the analysis of partisan counterporposals for the 2013 and 2017 redistricting process in relation with partisan ruling status, its strenght (vote returns), and state level coalition dynamics.  

The first part of the ProposalAnalysis.Rmd IS NOT CODE. It describes the general objectives of the analysis based on the hypotheses derived from the paper and the available data we have to test them. In all cases, the DV is related to a partyÂ´s decision to formulate a counterporposal. 

General Hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 assume the DV is if a party formulated a counterporposal,
and vary according the ruling party (H1), party strenght/vote returns (H2), and coalitions (H3).

Data frame: ys.proposed

Main unit of analysis: (party BY state AND year) -- summarize the actions each party took for each state in year -- NOT individual proposals

Measures (aggregated by STATE and YEAR )

- numproposals - number of proposals made by  party
- didPropose -  logical - whether party made any propoals -dummy variable derived from number of proposals > 0
- didControl - logical - whether party was in sole control of the state for the entire relevant period , derived from (control)
- didRule - logical whether party was in power at the end of the period, while redistricting takes place
- didWinever - party was in control at least once  during the period


State-level measures inherited from controlByWindow()
- partylist, partyseq, partytab, singlecontrol, percentsingle, primary, secondary, tertiary
State-level measures added:
- singlecontrol - dummy, where singlecontrol != NONE
NOTE: these  are measures of the STATE at that time, not specific to party
- partylist - names of parties in control of state over the relevant prior period, names may repeat if party control cycles back and forth
- year_2017 - indicator if year is 2017, based on (year)
- ruleparty - name of party that was in control at last year of period

Strategic Position Categorization

A party in a "strong" position political position in the state, then they are more likely to propose than a party with a less "strong" position.

The decision is a function of several variables such as: party controls the state during the redistricting year, if the party has been the sole ruler over from 1990-2013/17, and if they have ruled a majority of that timer period, if they have ruled at least once during that time period. 

The variables used in the decision tree embody levels of competition in each state. A state controlled by a single party during the period has low levels of political competition, for example. A state with a party which has not won a majority of elections but has won at least once has some degree of power in a competitive state (there are at least two parties competing), as another example. The former has a better "strategic position" than the latter. 

The "Strategic Positions" are defined as follows:
1. Party a) Controls during redistricting year b) has controlled state in all previous observed periods

2. Party a) Controls during redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods

3. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won a MAJORITY of previous elections in observed time period

4. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won a MINORITY of previous elections in observed time period

5.  Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won NONE of the previous elections during the time period

6. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won NONE of the previous elections during the time period d) another party has won ALL previous elections

#IV(2): Categorical variable capturing the level of vote returns (Five categories: Very High(>75%), High(74%-50%), Medium (49%-25%), Low (24%-15%), Very Low (<14%).
