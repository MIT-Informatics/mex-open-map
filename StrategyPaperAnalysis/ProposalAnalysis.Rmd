title: "Proposal Analysis"
output: html_notebook
---

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Description: This notebook file was created by A. Trelles on 12/28/19 as part of the Strategy Paper. 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

General Description: This analyisis is used as a reference to write the code for the analysis of partisan counterporposals for the 2013 and 2017 redistricting process in relation with partisan ruling status, its strenght (vote returns), and state level coalition dynamics.  

The first part of the ProposalAnalysis.Rmd IS NOT CODE. It describes the general objectives of the analysis based on the hypotheses derived from the paper and the available data we have to test them. In all cases, the DV is related to a partyÂ´s decision to formulate a counterporposal. 

General Hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 assume the DV is if a party formulated a counterporposal,
and vary according the ruling party (H1), party strenght/vote returns (H2), and coalitions (H3).

H1: Ruling Party (Single Party Dominance/Alternation)
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
H1.1: Decision of Entry (Party deciides if it plays the game based on Ruling Party at the state level) --> Decision of political parties to participate in redistricting based on degree of alternatioin at the state level.  
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Hypotheses (Entry --> Based on Ruling Party in Single Party Rule States):

#H.1.1 The ruling party is more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) than all other opposition parties. 

#H.1.2 Parties competing for power in that state (secondary or terciary forces) will be more likely to engage than smaller parties. 

#H.1.3 Parties ruling a state under single party dominance are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) than all other opposition parties. 

  Variables: 
#DV: Dummy variable capturing if party formulated a proposal (proposals.df: PROPOSED: True or False, by sate, stage, level, and year) Alternative (ys.proposed: proposed:0-4, by state and year).

#IV(1): Variable captruing if a single party ruled that state before redisrticting took place. We use two different time periods (2000-2013 and 2000-2017) based on the data grule.df (ys.proposed: CONTROL:singlecontrol,primary,"NONE"). 

#IV(2) Variable capturing which party was ruling the state the year redistricting took place (grule.df: party ruling by state in 2013 and 2017)

#IV(3) Variable capturing the relative presence/dominance of parties at the state level, based on the number of times they have ruled in the 2000-2013 and the 2000-2017 period (Priamry, Secondary, or Terciary Force). In case of tie, rank first the latest party to rule that state. 

#IV(4): Variable captruing the degree of alternation in power (six categories from a non-competitive  to multiparty comptetion and alternation has taken place 3+ times, for the 00-13 and 00-17 periods): 1) states dominated by a single party; 2) Alternation took place once (only two parties); 3) Alternation has taken place twice (with only two parties); 4) Alternation has taken place twice (with more than 3 parties); 5) Altrernation has taken place three times (involving 2 parties) 6) Altrernation has taken place three times (involving 3+ parties).--> **Need to create this variable --> Proposed Name: ALTERNATION**

  Objective:
# Evaluate the incentives parties to formulate counterproposals (decision to enter the process/to play the game) based on the Ruling Party hypotheis. --> We suspect that 1) parties ruling a state are more likely to engage in the process, 2) that parties competing for power in that state (secondary or terciary forces) will be more likely to engage than smaller parties, 3) that parties ruling a state under single party dominannce are more likely to formulate a counterproposal than those that are experience a higher degree of ALTERNATION/MULTIPARTY COMPETITION.  

  Descriptive Anslysis
  
#Visualization-->  1) Tables/graphs summarizing the total number of proposals made by each party during the 2013 and 2017 processes, by stage (firs vs second round), and at the local and national level. 2) Tables/graphs summarizing the total number of proposals made by each party at the state level; at the stage and year level--> Parties(actor) for 2013: "PAN PRI PRD PT PVEM MC PNA" Parties for 2017: "PAN PRI PRD PT PVEM MC PNA MORENA ES"

  
  Propositions/Questions realted to H1 to be Evaluated (Code developed by RA)

#H.1.1 The ruling party is more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) than all other opposition parties. 

#H.1.2  Parties competing for power in that state (secondary or terciary forces) will be more likely to engage than smaller parties. 

#H.1.3 Parties ruling a state under single party dominance are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) than all other opposition parties.

H1.2: Strategic Decision (Party deciides how to play the game based on the Ruling Party at the state level) --> Decision of a political party to participate in redistricting based on degree of alternatioin at the state level.  
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Hypotheses (stage --> First vs Second Round):
 
#H.1.2.1.1 Parties are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) during the first round. 

#H.1.2.1.2 Parties ruling a state under single party dominance, are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) during the first round, than all other opposition parties. 


#H.1.2.1.3 Parties that are secondary or terciary forces at the state level, are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) during the first round, than all other opposition parties.

#1.2.1.4 As alternation in power/competition increases at the state level, the number of counterporposals in the second stage will be higher compared to states dominated by a single party.

Hypotheses (level --> CLV vs Federal):

#H.1.2.2.1 As alternation in power/competition increases at the state level, parties are more likely to formulate a counterproposal at the local level (CLV)

Hypotheses (Process --> 2013 vs 2017):

#H.1.2.3.1 Parties are more likely to formulate a counterproposal at the local level (CLV) in 2017 than in 2013.

H1: Ruling Party (Single Party Dominance/Alternation)
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
H1.1: Single Party Dominance (dominant party) --> Comparing dominant parties vs opposition parties in states ruled by a single party
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Hypothesis:
# If a state is dominated by a single party prior the redistricting process, the ruling party in that state is more likely to formulate a counterproposal than any other party. 

Variables: 
#DV: Dummy variable capturing if party formulated a proposal (PROPOSED: True or False, by Sate, by round, by year).

#IV(1): Dummy variable captruing if a single party ruled that state before redisrticting took place (single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State). 

#IV(2): Categorical variable captruing the degree of alternation in power (six categories from a non-competitive state to a party that has multiparty comptetion and alternation has taken place >3+ times in the 00-17 period): 1) single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State; 2) alt_power1_00_17; 3) alt_power2_00_17; 4) alt_power2_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17; 5) alt_power3_00_17; 6) alt_power3_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17. 

Method:
#To test H1.1: chi.sq test.

#Comparing parties:If the hypothesis is true, we would expect that the dominating party in states ruled by a single party, is more likely to formulate a counterporposal than opposition parties (this hypothesis can be tested by stage and/or combining both stages 1 and 2).

Hypotheses:
# If a state has gone through alternation in power, the main oppoition party (secondary force) is as likely to formulate a counterporposal as the ruling party.

# If a state has gone through alternation in power, oppoition parties are as likely to formulate a counterporposal as the ruling party.

Variables: 
#DV: Dummy variable capturing if party formulated a proposal (PROPOSED: True or False, by Sate, by round, by year).

#IV(1): Dummy variable captruing if a single party ruled that state before redisrticting took place (single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State).

Method: 
#To test H1.1: chi.sq test.

#Comparing parties: In states that have experienced alternation in power, we expect the main opposition parties to be as likely as the dominating party to formulate a counterproposal. We expect a stronger effect as multiparty competition and alternation in power increase (this hypothesis can be tested by stage and/or combining both stages 1 and 2).

Hypothesis:
# Paries in states with alternetion and multipary competition are more likely to formulate a higher number of counterproposals being formulated than prties in states that are dominated by a single party. 

or 

#As alternation and multipartycompetition incease, more proposals will be formulated.

Variables: 
#DV: Total number of counterproposals formulated. Based on the dummy variable capturing if party formulated a proposal (PROPOSED: True or False, by Sate, by round, by year).

#IV(1): Dummy variable captruing if a single party ruled that state before redisrticting took place (single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State). 

#IV(2): Categorical variable captruing the degree of alternation in power (six categories from a non-competitive state to a party that has multiparty comptetion and alternation has taken place >3+ times in the 00-17 period): 1) single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State; 2) alt_power1_00_17; 3) alt_power2_00_17; 4) alt_power2_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17; 5) alt_power3_00_17; 6) alt_power3_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17. 

Method: 
#To test H1.1: chi.sq test.

# If the hpothesis is true, we would expect to observe more counterporposals in states with more alternation and multiparty competition.
