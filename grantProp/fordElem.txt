PROJECT INFORMATION 
Describe the purpose of the project (100 words maximum)
The process of selecting electoral boundaries offers opportunities for political manipulation, especially when not subject to public view. Next summer, Mexico will redraw its federal electoral boundaries behind closed doors. We propose to increase the transparency of and participation in the process of redistricting by making all data and analysis tools available to the public and the press, and engaging a wider audience in commenting on the process and in proposing electoral maps. By building on award-winning, cloud-deployable software developed for participative redistricting in the United States, ITAM will enable greater accountability at low marginal cost.

Outline the problems and issues the project will address (100 words maximum)
The problem is exacerbated when we move from the federal to the state level. Criteria used for subnational redistricting are virtually unknown. Yet once deployed at the federal level, the software requires minimal adjustments to evaluate any state in particular. Whenever a state government acts to redistrict (or, as is common, doesn't for decades), advocacy groups or anyone with an internet connection will have tools draw plans and measure the impact of the proposals. This effort will be hosted by ITAM, Mexicoâ€™s leading academic institution, providing a key position from which to engage advocacy groups and the media.
