  I sent the house of representatives data today.  It should be arranged
properly and labelled in a relatively self-explanatory way.  LDPVOTE is
the vote for the LDP (Liberals before 1958); LDPS is the number of seats
won by the LDP; LDPD is the number of seats the LDP would have won if
d'hondt was used to allocate seats.  There are three files, hr3 for three-
member districts, hr4 for four-member, and hr5 for five-member.

  I will have the upper house data soon and the district level data by
the weekend I think.

  Steve
