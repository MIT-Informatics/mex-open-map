Description: This notebook file was created by A. Trelles on 12/3/19 as part of the Strategy Paper. 

General Description of the Data: The data file "RulingPartyLong.df" was created by A. Trelles on 12/3/19 and it is available on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oV81og-SVMv8IMtqflahr_ljbK4h_rCdTFTLnlIU7_E/edit?usp=sharing on a wide format. The spreadsheet contains the ruling party (governorship) at the state level for the time period 1990-2019 in five year intervals and includes the year a federal redistricting process took place (1996, 2004, 2013, and 2017). The data source is https://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mexico_states.htm. 

Objectives: i. create a notebook in R studio to read an original data file that has been transformed from wide into a long format using Stata, ii. read the file located in  the data environment for the project StrategyPaperAnalysis, iii. register data manipulation, iv. transorm the data intro a longitudinal/time series format (state, year, and party), v. create different measures of party presence/dominance at the state level, and vi. create some descriptive statistics using the information.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
H1.1: Decision of Entry (Party deciides if it plays the game based on Ruling Party at the state level) --> Decision of political parties to participate in redistricting based on degree of alternatioin at the state level.  
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Hypotheses (Entry --> Based on Ruling Party):

#H.1.1.1 Parties ruling a state under single party dominance, are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal), than all other opposition parties. 

  Variables: 
#DV: Dummy variable capturing if party formulated a proposal (proposals.df: PROPOSED: True or False, by Sate, round, level, year) --> **This variable needs to be created --> Proposed Name: ENTRY**.

#IV(1): Dummy variable captruing if a single party ruled that state before redisrticting took place (StateDat: single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State).

#IV(2) Nominal variable capturing which party was the primary political force (StateDat: primary_pol_force_00_15:Party Name (PRI, PAN, PRD), by State)

#IV(3): Categorical variable captruing the degree of alternation in power (six categories from a non-competitive state to a party that has multiparty comptetion and alternation has taken place >3+ times in the 00-17 period): 1) single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State; 2) alt_power1_00_17; 3) alt_power2_00_17; 4) alt_power2_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17; 5) alt_power3_00_17; 6) alt_power3_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17.--> **Need to create this variable from previous categories already created in Statedat --> Proposed Name: ALTERNATION**

  Method:
# Evaluate if parties ruling a state that has not experienced alternantion in power, are more likely to formulate a counterproposal than opposition parties. If true, ruling parties in states that have been ruled by a single party, should be more likely to formulate a plan when compared to: a) other parties in that same state and b) in states that have experienced a degree of alternation in power.

ORDINAL MODEL INTERPRETATION
Ordinal Regression Interpretation
The hypothesis being considered is such that: A political party, or coalition of parties, with a higher “strategic position” will be more likely to propose a redistricting plan in a state regardless of the redistricting process stage or the level of government from which the party is proposing. The “strategic position” of a singular party is broadly defined as a measure of party political influence/power/”market share” [party competition][like a monopoly] in a state in a given year. We can define six unique “strategic positions” with the available data where being in “strategic position” one (1) corresponds with being in the best position to propose a redistricting plan whereas six (6) corresponds to the worst position from which to propose a redistricting plan.

The "Strategic Positions" are defined as follows:
1. Party a) Controls during redistricting year b) has controlled state in all previous observed periods
2. Party a) Controls during redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods
3. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won a MAJORITY of previous elections in observed time period
4. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won a MINORITY of previous elections in observed time period
5.  Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won NONE of the previous elections during the time period [EDIT for REDUNDANCY]
6. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won NONE of the previous elections during the time period d) another party has won ALL previous elections

The “strategic position” of a party coalition and its member parties is defined similarly to what was just described, but where the coalition and its member parties all assume the “strategic position” which is highest among the member parties in the coalition. For example; if PRI has a strategic position of one (1) and it forms a coalition with PVEM and MORENA, both of which have a “strategic position” of six (6), the coalition and all member parties are considered to have a “strategic position” equal to one (1) – the highest of all three member parties. 

[DESCRIPTION OF STRATPOS DISTRIBUTION]
MODEL

[INCLUDE LINKS] – look into if hyperlinks can be done
Given [our type of data] the most suited model is [blank].
{Describe the functions]

The author of the ordinal package in R has written extensive documentations on how to best use the model and how to interpret the results of statistical models built using the clm, clm2, clmm, and clmm2 functions in the package. For our purposes, the clmm and clmm2 functions are appropriate for modeling the hypothesis we are evaluating given the data at hand. Both functions, clmm and clmm2, allow for an ordinal independent variables (StratPos) as long as the dependent variable is also ordinal or a factor (didPropose). As has been demonstrated, “strategic position” is treated as ordinal in our methodology. Using both clmm and clmm2 functions, the statistical model is specified as such.

CLMM
 
CLMM2
 
The output of the model is such.

CLMM
 
CLMM2
 
The coefficients of the ordinal independent variables are treated the same as coefficients of a general logit model. We find that only one of the “strategic positions,” StratPos #4 is significant -- that it is associated with and explains some of the variation in the dependent variable -- that a party in a state proposes a redistricting plan. A party in a state that has a Strategic Position = 4 is less likely to propose a redistricting plan than parties in states with a higher value of “strategic position.”
