* WAIT Mail on kml maps
Dear Dr. Halvard Buhaug, 
My co-authors and I are working towards the revision of our manuscript. We should have it ready soon. I wish to inquire about digital maps that may be appropriate to illustrate the piece. 
I visited Elsevier's Interactive Map Viewer. Unless I missed something, the example articles feature very simple maps pinpointing the studies' area(s). I have, however, prepared more elaborate kml files showing several features of federal districts --- such as coloring secciones according to recent electoral history, or adding bubbles indicating how many voters are registered --- in selected Mexican states. It should be straightforward to represent key variables in the manuscript (district malapportionment, turnout, and boundaries) in these maps. But Elsevier's verification tool will not show my maps. (One example is http://ericmagar.com/data/maps/distFed/googleEarth/bc.kmz).
Two questions come to mind. How could I gauge how much of the problem is due to my inexperience with map-making or to the system's capacity? Would it be suitable to refer readers in a footnote to the repository where my kml files can be downloaded?
Thank you for your advise.
Best,

- Need a little more detail on the MCMC algorithm
- Need more context for non-Mexico scholars

* Reviewer #2
** NOCRITIQUE This MS deals with partisan bias, in terms of discrepancies between seat and vote shares, looking more closely at three particular sources of such bias. Using data from recent Mexican elections, the paper details a procedure on how to calculate the different sources of this bias in single-member district systems where more than two parties compete.

- EM action: no action needed, no critique.

** NOCRITIQUE I have to admit from the outset that I'm no expert on this particular topic, although I am familiar with it and work on topics that are not too far removed. Hence, my comments are those of a "generalist reviewer", and are more related to the framing of the paper and different conceptual issues that are not entirely clear to me.
   CLOSED: [2016-04-11 Mon 16:14]
- EM action: no action needed, no critique.

** NOCRITIQUE But, my overall impression of this MS is that it has the potential to make a nice contribution to the literature and study of partisan bias, not the least because the authors provide a very clear template describing how others could go about in calculating partisan bias in other single-member district system. The summary of sources of partisan biases and the comprehensive treatment and discussion of the issue also makes for a good overview, also for those not working closely on the topic (such as myself). The methods and design are transparent, and mostly well justified, and from what I can understand the analysis is well conducted. I think this could become a publishable article, even in a top outlet such as Political Geography, without too much extra effort on the part of the authors. Still, there are a few things that need to be revisited before the MS is publishable.
   CLOSED: [2016-04-11 Mon 16:14]
- EM action: no action needed, no critique.

** DONE The first issue relates to the "dual framing" of the paper: There is the methodological procedure for calculating sources of bias when there are more than two parties, and there are the substantive results on party biases for the larger Mexican parties. I think the main contribution is the former and this is also mostly how this paper is framed. However, there are parts of the paper that reads as if the results for Mexican bias is the key contribution, and the "dual framing" is also reflected in the rather lengthy (but well written) sections on Mexico starting on p.13.
   CLOSED: [2016-05-07 Sat 08:38]
- Point addressed below.
** DONE I would go for a purer methodological framing of this paper, and make even clearer that Mexico is "just" an application/illustration (even if it is an interesting one, and for a large country). This could potentially go together with shortening the discussion on Mexico, and  freeing up some more space for discussion about the methodological choices and potential problems, conceptual discussions of the various sources of bias etc. There is another particular reason why I think this way of framing the paper is advantageous: As the authors remark, Mexico is a mixed-member electoral system, with a PR tier to reduce disproportionality. This is completely left out of the authors' analysis. While the authors make some pertinent remarks about effects of partisan bias in the single-member tier on political behavior on pp.13-14, it is still the case that we cannot learn much about the overall extent of partisan bias and issues of representation in the Mexican system from this analysis: There will be in all likelihood be a huge upwards bias, and statements such as those made in the abstract concerning the "partisan bias in favor of Mexico's former hegemonic ruling party" etc will be misleading to those who just skim the paper and do not read carefully. If the authors want to make a substantive contribution on partisan bias in a particular country, they would then either need to incorporate the PR tier when discussing overall partisan bias in Mexico, or choose another country  that is a pure single-member system.
   CLOSED: [2016-05-07 Sat 08:38]
- Point addressed below.
- Might raise issue with other reviewers?
- This is actually how an earlier version of the paper went about.
- Point addressed below.
** DONE However, if the authors rather chose to frame this even more clearly as a methodological contribution with single-member tier of Mexico as an illustration, I think this issue is not too big (substantive conclusions on overall bias in Mexico would still need to come with some clear caveats, however, so the abstract, for example, would need re-phrasing.
   CLOSED: [2016-04-25 Mon 11:32]
*** CONCEDE Reviewer #2 recommended reframing the manuscript more clearly as a methodological contribution with the single-member tier of Mexico as an illustration. We have adopted this recommendation, rewriting the introduction and the abstract accordingly. We also trimmed the disussion of Mexico considerably, especially section 4 on Diputado elections, but also section 5 on malapportionment. This is an improvement in the manuscript, with sharp focus in the method to measure partisan bias sources in multi-party competition. We acknowledge the referee's suggestion, as it helped avoid the thorny issue of dropping the PR tier frm the analysis. 
** NOCRITIQUE I basically buy the approach, and the different sources of bias all seem plausible and are well discussed. Still, there are a couple of things that could be discussed/elaborated on:
   CLOSED: [2016-04-15 Fri 11:33]
- EM action: no action needed, no critique.

** DONE First, it is not clear from the outset how measuring pure partisan bias is/can be differentiated from biases related to the size of the party and characteristics of the system favoring larger parties in general (not because of the party's identity, but because of its size). For example, consider two hypothetical elections in which two parties A and B receive the exact same vote share in all districts in a given election. In election 1, A receives 51% and B 49% of votes, in all districts, and A receives all delegates. In election 2, B receives 51% in all districts and all delegates. Now, to me, I wouldn't say that the system is necessarily biased in favor of  A in the first election and B in the second; this is not about the party's identity but about the responsiveness of the system (which does not change from election 1 to 2). An early clarifying discussion, which should be really simple so that non-experts can understand, of how such issues are conceptually handled when delineating what is partisan bias, and a clarification if this truly matters for any of the sources of bias calculated would be very welcome.
   CLOSED: [2016-05-24 Tue 18:15]
- Conceded. As suggested by Reviewer 2, we have expanded the discussion of the rho parameter in section 1 to attempt a clarification of how measuring pure partisan bias is/can be differentiated from biases related to the size of the party and characteristics of the system favoring larger parties in general (not because of the party's identity, but because of its size). 

** CONCEDE Second, given the definition of party bias, I see why the "turnout-based" bias should be part of it. However, one problem here that could be discussed is that turnout in a given district is not something that is exogenously given, but rather affected by the actions and campaign strategies of the different parties. Parties may, for example, campaign harder to get out the vote in districts that are close to call, and some parties may simply be better at winning such districts. Hence, if, let's say the PRI wins a lot of high-turnout districts, it could be due to some inherent actions and capacities of the party, and in a sense it would be wrong to consider this a bias against the PRI in the system. I don't think this is a very big issue, but I think it merits some discussion.

** CONCEDE Considering PRI-Green as an alliance and assigning all wins to PRI seems to be a major assumption (which the authors are open about). Now, even if the substantive results for Mexico is downplayed, it would also be interesting from a general point of view to know by how much such assumptions alter the results and conclusions. What happens to the results if PRI-Green is measured as one entity, for example (as suggested on top p.16)?
- Do three estimations for 2009: (1) Pri=Pri-Green (as reported). (2) PRI-Green across the board. (3) PRI, PRI-Green, Green. Report 2 and 3 in appendix

** CONCEDE The rationale for studying partisan bias for each election separately is well explained. However, what if one wants to generalize and test for a systematic bias (or even particular systematic such sources) for/against a party within a system that lasted for a specific period of time? I understand that creeping malapportionment and turnout will change by the election, but if researchers want to make such generalizations, how could they apply/alter your framework to produce (at least rough) tests of this. It's interesting to come up with exact numbers for a particular election, but sometimes the question is whether this is an inherent/more systematic feature of the system, and as the authors show some sources of bias show substantial changes between elections, favoring a party in one and disfavoring it in the next. If the authors could devise a strategy for conducting such a test, this would greatly enhance their contribution, I think.
- No clue... longitudinal pool of Linzer sims? longitudinal a la Marquez? State-level multiplications? Something else?

** DEFEND Very minor point: Population levels in districts are based on linear interpolations between censuses. Following standard models of population growth, it would be more appropriate to assume constant population growth rates over the time interval, which can easily be calculated (meaning that population growth in absolute numbers will be smaller for earlier years, if growth is positive).
- Estimating intercensal populations in units of analysis is no small task. The key problem appears to be the choice of a functional form that both smoothes the rate of population growth while also taking the values actually observed on three census years (2000, 2005, and 2010). An exponential form between pairs of census does a good job for years between observations, but not before and after, nor does it treat "transitions from one pair to the next smoothly. A polinomial form would allow work with all three census counts, but also seems problematic for proecting estimates beyond 2010. Since all this requires demographic knowledge beyond our ability, we opted for the simpler linear estimation instead.
** NOCRITIQUE All in all, I learned a lot from reading this paper, and I think it is a very good piece of scholarly work. I recommend that the authors are given the chance to revise and resubmit the paper.

* Reviewer #3
** NOCRITIQUE This article was a pleasure to read and to evaluate. It is well written, with a theory clearly presented, interesting findings, and a contribution to the estimation of seats and votes in multi-party systems. The article brings together three different traditions in the study of seats and votes, unifying them in a model that allows researchers to discriminate the sources of biases in multi-party races. The article will be of interest to those that conduct basic research on seat-vote models as well as those interested in the mechanical properties of electoral rules in Mexico. Consequently, I recommend publication as is.
   CLOSED: [2016-04-11 Mon 16:18]
- EM action: no action needed, no critique.

** NOCRITIQUE I do not have recommended changes to the article. The article is honest in stating that it is an original and interesting improvement on existing models but not a radically different modeling strategy. I appreciate that the article does not try to oversell their contribution or findings. 
   CLOSED: [2016-04-11 Mon 16:18]
- EM action: no action needed, no critique.

** CONCEDE That said, the authors could be more aggressive in the introduction to convey to readers how the current article changes prior conventional wisdom in the Mexican election and what contributions will result from estimating their model in other electoral systems. Beyond that, I could only hope that every manuscript I have to review would be such an easy and interesting reading.

* Reviewer #4

** NOCRITIQUE This paper intends to identify the relative and (assumed independent) impact of three different components of partisan bias  in the Mexican electoral system. Application case are lower-chamber federal legislative elections 2003-2012. The paper focuses exclusively on the single member districts  component of the Mexican electoral system.
   CLOSED: [2016-04-11 Mon 16:19]
- EM action: no action needed, no critique.

** DONE The objective of this paper is ambitious. The authors claim to combine most important methodical contributions in this context (Grofman et al. 1997, King 1990, Linzer 2012).  More specifically, it aims at separating the relative impact of malapportionment, boundary delimitations, and differential turnout in an additive multinomial logit model. Sometimes, one has the impression, that a failed redistricting reform is at the center of the paper --- which is confusing.
   CLOSED: [2016-05-29 Sun 17:46]
- EM action: conceded. 
- For new cover letter (by EM): By de-emphasizing the Mexican case in order to highlight the methodological contribution, we have also done our best to remove Reviewer 4's impression that the failed redistricting reform is confusingly at the center of the paper. Analysis uses the map that was not implemented as part of the hypothetical analysis, offering perspective on the effect of reducing malapportionment (much else constant) on our measure of partisan bias and its components.
** DONE Description and discussion of the Mexican electoral system is negligent. The author writes: "Section 4 describes Mexico's mixed-member electoral system, isolating the plurality tier for analysis" (p. 5). The description of the electoral system can actually be found in footnote 5. But  what does 'isolating' mean? The authors state: "We examine, in isolation, the elections held in the single member plurality-win districts. We do so because all voting and most campaigning take place in the plurality tier." The reviewer considers this legitimation as not sufficient. Note that the current Mexican electoral system includes stipulations balancing excessive partisan bias and including compensation schemes. More specifically, the electoral law prescribes an upper bound of seat-vote deviation of 8%. The is not referred in the paper. Why ? Actually, estimating partisan bias for the SMD component exclusively without referring to this stipulation seems to be misleading.
   CLOSED: [2016-05-29 Sun 17:54]
- EM action: conceded. 
- Text for cover letter (by EM): While analysis of SMD seats without the compensatory PR tier can be defended, it is no longer necessary. By reframing the paper as a methodological contribution with an illustrative (and interesting) application to the plurality tier of the Mexican electoral system---as advised by Reviewer 2---it is justified to ignore the PR tier. We have nonetheless added a paragraph (in section 4) elaborating how the substantive partisan bias results presented for *plurality seats only* have implications for the larger mixed system. We also added the 8 percent over-representation rule, which we had previously neglected to mention.

** DONE One would never seriously propose, to measure partisan bias exclusively for the SMD component in a mixed system like, e.g. the German electoral system.
   CLOSED: [2016-05-25 Wed 18:00]
- EM action: conceded. 
- Text for cover letter: none, answered above. 
** DONE It is reasonable to expect strategic coordination of parties, candidates and voters in this context. The paper does not propose a theory what partisan bias means in such a setting. The authors cite Calvo/Micozzi (2005) but do not systematically take into account their arguments, especially the insight that "with more than two parties the relative change in seats depends critically on changes in the number of parties" (Calvo/Micozzi p. 1051)
   CLOSED: [2016-05-30 Mon 18:19]
- EM action: defend our approach, mild concession.
- Text for cover letter (by EM): If the vote threshold to win another seat can be anticipated, strategic coordination is the attempt to pool votes (or remove opportunities to spread votes thin) in order to reach that threshold. Other things constant, the threshold should be lower for bias-favored parties than for other parties, and partisan bias should therefore remove incentives for bias-favored parties to coordinate strategically with others. If that were so, however, bias-unfavored parties have incentives to coordinate, joining forces in an attempt to overcome their disadvantage by accruing the large-party bonus associated with parameter rho. These simple statements suggest one obstacle to a theory of what partisan bias means under strategic coordination: it is unlikely that other things remain constant. In particular, gauging the relation between partisan bias and strategic coordination is contingent also on parameter rho. A formal exposition of this is Cox and Katz's (2002, chapter 3) model of the value to parties of redistricting plans, where utility is a function of both lambda and rho. Since our paper is focused in lambdas only, we do not undertake such a theory. 
- Text for cover letter (continued, by EM): Regarding multipartism, Calvo and Micozzi show that increasing party competition pulls the votes-seats curve leftward (fig. 1-c). This is precisely what partisan bias achieves---but for a favored party only: a more efficient votes to seats conversion. Bias produces a rightward shift for unfavored parties: a less efficient votes to seats conversion. So whereas the effect of multipartism remains symmetric, partisan bias does not. We have added a footnote at the end of section 1 to cover this.
- Questions for co-authors: Should we keep the new foonote, or drop this? Can it be clarified?

** DONE Section 3 is titled 'Measurement via Monte Carlo simulation'. I guess, the authors mean 'estimation'. The one-page section is not very instructive --- it provides no detailed insights to the applied procedure. The description of the modeling approach is not precise enough. (Some details are provided in footnote 14 in the results section).  More details of the formal setup (including the electoral system) are necessary. The derivation from, and the combination of the existing approaches should be precise and transparent.
   CLOSED: [2016-06-03 Fri 20:53]
- EM action: conceded.
- Section 3 now describes the modeling approach more explicitely. We have also written an on-line appendix (included along this re-submission) to accompany the article if it gets published. The appendix elaborates on the full applied procedure in a step-by-step approach, also serving as introduction to the code to replicate the analysis (that will be posted on-line upon publication). In particular, the appendix offer detail about the Monte Carlo to generate a large number of hypothetical national elections for each year (the Linzer method), and how three methods combine into our proposed procedure. 
- We also replaced `measurement' with `estimation' in the section name. 
- The attached appendix is still a work in progress, we plan to polish it if the article gets accepted. 

** TRUE? The authors use a multinomial logit type of model --- I missed a discussion of the crucial assumption of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) which implies equal substitution patterns which may not be met. 
- see King p. 168 for 1st point, true?
** HALFWAY How do the authors account for districts with varying sets and sizes of candidates in the estimation?
- EM action: clarified in text and expanded in the on-line appendix. 
- Expand on Linzer's patterns of competition and my dummies (two ways: adapt code for exact number of parties in election, or use dummies to drop redundant columns). Expanded in appendix, with a mention in text.
** DEFEND On p. 21, the authors state: "Leaving aside the question of how meaningful the estimated quantities are..."  I admit that this statement is somewhat disturbing. The interpretation and usage of the estimated effects seem to be problematic: it is meanwhile established knowledge that coefficients of multiple nonlinear functions (as in MNL)  cannot be interpreted simply based on statistical significance, and even on the sign of a coefficient. Covariates have to be explicitly fixed for explicit values in order to get conditional probabilities / market shares, marginals and elasticies. Insafar the study should reassess the impact of the estimated coefficients for relevant and typical situations, and for the respective partisan biases in terms of  changes in market shares. E.g., illustrative scenarios in Table 1 could be provided for estimated coefficients.

** CONCEDE Table 3 uses OLS regression for deriving swing ratios: "We derive swing ratios by regressing a party's seat shares in simulated elections on the party's simulated vote shares." Does this regression account for the uncertainity/credibility of simulated shares?

But they are concentrated in suburban areas with fast demographic growth since the 1990s. Estimates for 2003--2012 have changed, but they tell the same general story.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{F:disRelPop2006map} illustrates how creeping malapportionment affects Mexico's redistricting. We project inter-census populations linearly to estimate yearly district growth.\footnote{More precisely, the 2000--2005 rate of growth was used before year 2006, and the 2005--2010 rate afterwards. Population projections for different maps were done after secci\'on census populations had been aggregated into actual or hypothetical districts. Performing linear projection on secciones before any aggregation might have been preferable (because they are much smaller geographic units), but a fair amount of over-populated secciones are routinely split into new ones between elections, complicating the projection exercise.} Compared to the 2000 census, projected district populations in 2006 are off by 9.7\% in absolute value on average, with a standard deviation of 10.6\%. With one additional year away from the reference census, the 1997 map had even less success achieving proper representation. Indexing 2000 census district populations at 100, as the figure does, reveals how different the most demographically dynamic units were on paper and in reality. The fastest-growing district was 88\% larger in 2006 than what census data otherwise suggested (the line labeled `max'). The district shedding most population was 16\% smaller (the `min' line). These are outliers, but central tendencies reflect sizable lags as well. The inter-quartile range (lines Q.25 and Q.75) covered 1\%--13\% above census in the 2006 election, and expanded to 4\%--20\%, 7\%--27\%, and 10\%--35\% in the three subsequent elections using the same map.

%One year closer to census makes a huge difference, as the abandoned map for 2015 reveals (although this is probably compounded with a less dynamic demography): the dotted vertical line at year 2013 reports how the new plan might have looked, had it been adopted.
