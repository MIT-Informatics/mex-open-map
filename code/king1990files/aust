Douglas w. Rae. 1971. THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF ELECTORAL LAWS. New haven: yale university press.
P.95: "The sources of this unusual association between a P.R. Formula and two-party competition are not doubt complex, and would require detailed research if a full explanation were desired.

Apparently, divisive political forces were too few and too weak to sustain these elective parties."

P.133: electoral changes in 1971: "Electors were now entitled to cast only one vote for one candidate."
(®MDUL¯Me®MDNM¯: is this the Japanese system, where, in multimember districts, voters still only get to vote for a single candidate.  The top plurality vote getters win.)
P.134: "Austrian experience has in some respects been such as to defy the expectations of what the workings of an electoral system are likely to be."
