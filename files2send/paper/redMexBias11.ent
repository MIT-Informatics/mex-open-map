macro:->From
\citet
[][:Fig.~1]{calvo.micozzi.govReform.2005},
we
can
expect
that
center
to
shift
progressively
to
the
left
as
party
competition
increases.
We
note
that
partisan
bias
achieves
precisely
such
a
leftward
pull---but
for
a
favored
party
only:
a
more
efficient
votes
to
seats
conversion.
For
unfavored
parties,
the
pull
is
rightward.
So
whereas
the
effect
of
multipartism
remains
symmetric,
that
of
partisan
bias
does
not.
We
are
grateful
to
an
anonymous
referee
for
pointing
this
out.

macro:->Other
elements
highlighted
by
\citet
{gudgin.taylor.1980decomposeBias}
that
our

raw
partisan
bias
ignores
are
the
cube-law's
bonus,
large
third-party
votes,
and
possible
interactions
between
all
the
elements.
The
bonus
is,
in
fact,
captured
by
the
system's
responsiveness
parameter
and
therefore
distinct
from
partisan
bias
in
our
framework
(more
on
this
in
section

departures
from
bipartism
explicitly.

The

straightforward
in
balanced,
two-party
competition
\citep
[see][:410]{linzerSeatVoteElasticity2012},

not
when
multiple
parties
compete.
We
therefore
partially
follow
his

borrowing

simulate
national
party
vote
and
seat
pairs,
then
fitting

macro:->We
thank
one
anonymous

drawing
attention
to
this
consideration.
We
acknowledge
that
studying
plurality
races
in
isolation
does
some
injustice
to
mixed
system
electoral
politics,
as
the
PR
tier
is
likely
to
have
effects
on
how
parties
run
plurality
campaigns.
The
case
that
naturally
comes
to
mind
is
a
hopeless
party
entering
district
races
in
order
to
accrue
votes
helping
it
elect
PR
deputies.
In
national-level
studies,
such
as
ours,
the
importance
of
behavior
of
this
nature
relates
inversely
to
party
size.
It
should
be
negligible
for
the
major

that

interested

macro:->The
comparative
survey
by
\citet
{snyder.samuelsMalapp2004}

Mexico
among
well-apportioned

reported

for
the
1997
map,
but
no
guidance
is
offered
about
the
population
figures
used

We
suspect
reliance---as
the
board
did
then
and
still
does
now---on
raw
1990
census
data,
severely
underestimated
Mexico's
malapportionment.

afterwards.
Population
projections
for
different

were
done
after
secci\'on

had
been
aggregated
into
actual

Performing
linear

on
secciones

might
have
been
preferable
(because
they

much
smaller
geographic

but
a

split

macro:->Besides
the
meaningless
.5
vote
share
threshold
discussed
in
section
\ref
{S:bias},
the
compositional
nature
of
multi-party
vote
shares
adds
another
layer
of
complexity.
Unlike
linear
regression,
the
logit
link
in
equation
\ref
{E:kingBi}
complicates
assessment
of
individual
$\lambda
$s'
impact
on
seat
shares.
One
common
approach,
comparative
statics
analysis
through
simulation
\citep
[e.g.,][]{tomz.etal.2001}---i.e.,
letting
the
regressor
of
interest
fluctuate
while
all
others
remain
constant
at
illustrative
values---is
inapplicable
to
compositional
multi-party
votes:
when
$v_p$
fluctuates,
the
other
vote
shares
cannot
remain
constant.
Uniform
and
proportional
swing
models
overcome
this
complication
by
assuming
simple
ways
in
which
votes
are
won/lost
relative
to
other
parties.
Since
the
problem
is
an
empirical
one,
we
prefer
evaluation
of
how
important
bias
estimates
are
through
swing
ratios
analysis
of
simulated
elections---like
Linzer
does.

the
analysis,
this

excludes

compensatory
PR

the
8

ceiling
on
overrepresentation.
When
the
full
mixed
system
is
considered---as
implied
by
the
slice
of
seats
needed
for
majority
status---swing
ratios
will
approximate
unity.
