The model estimated by this program appears in Gary King, "Electoral
Responsiveness and Partisan Bias in Multiparty Democracies," mimeo, Harvard
University.  The two-party version of this model can be found in Gary King and
Robert Browning, "Democratic Representation and Partisan Bias in Congressional
Elections," AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW, 81, 4 (December, 1987): 1251-
1273.  The program will automatically estimate the two-party version of the
model if data from only two parties are included.

DATA.
Data on votes and seats must be available in a Gauss data file, with variable
names.  See the description of the program ATOG.EXE (Ascii To Gauss) in the
Gauss manual.  Note that BILOGIT.PRG expects the NUMBERS of votes and seats,
rather than percentages or proportions.  Rows should be elections; columns
(variables) should be the number of seats and votes for each party.

SETUP.
You must install Gauss version 2, and the Gauss program MAXLIK.SET (module 7).
If module 7 this is not automatically loaded upon startup, execute:

>> run maxlik.set

The program file is BILOGIT.PRG.  To obtain estimates, edit this file, make the
appropriate changes (described below), and execute it (by pressing F2 from the
editor or by typing >> run BILOGIT.prg).

OPTIONS.
All nine options are set at the start of BILOGIT.PRG and are described here.
1.  Name the Gauss dataset with the following command:  dataset="brit";
2.  You may choose which estimator to run by setting the variable est.
    est=0;  constrains partisan bias (lambdas) to zero and estimates
            responsiveness (rho).
    est=1;  estimates rho and a lambda for each party.  The lambda for the
            first party named below is set to zero for identification; the
            choice of which party to set to zero is arbitrary and will not
            affect substantive conclusions.
    est=2;  Alters option est=1 so that rho is allowed to vary linearly with
            Taagepera's Index.  Thus, the program gives estimates of the
            lambdas plus g0 and g1, where rho=g0+g1*(taagepera's index).
    est=3;  Alters option est=1 so that rho is allowed to vary linearly with
            the last two digits of the year.  Thus, the program gives estimates
            of the lambdas plus g0 and g1, where rho=g0+g1*(year).
3.  You may include all non-major parties in a single "other" category by
    setting incoth=1;  Setting incoth=0; excludes these other parties.
4.  The index variable names are included in the votes variable.  For example,
    votes=iconsv| ilabv; will include two parties in the analysis, consv and
    labv.
5.  Votes for parties to be included in the other category (if incoth=1) are
    named in otherv.  For example:  otherv=iothv| ilibv; will create a party
    called otherv by summing the votes for parties othv and libv.
6.  The index variable names are included in the seats variable.  For example,
    seats=iconss| ilabs; will include two parties in the analysis, conss and
    labs.
7.  Seats for parties to be included in the other category (if incoth=1) are
    named in others.  For example:  others=ioths| ilibs; will create a party
    called others by summing the votes for parties oths and libs.  Set
    others=0; and incoth=0; if you do not plan to use this option.
8.  The index variable name for the number of districts is assigned to the
    variable ndist.  For example, ndist=itseats;.
9.  The index variable name for the year in four digits is named in vyear.  For
    example:  vyear=iyear; if the variable is called year.

OUTPUT.
An example Gauss dataset, in files BRIT.DHT and BRIT.DAT, is included on the
program disk.  The ASCII version of these data are in BRIT.ASC.
If you copy this to the same directory as BILOGIT.PRG, you can
check to see if everything is working by running the program as is.
The output, which appears on the screen and in a file with the same name as
your dataset, but with the extension ".OUT", should look like the following:

Computation Time:   6.04 seconds   Iterations:  18
Dependent variables (seats): CONSS LABS  LIBS
Mean Votes:  0.450  0.422  0.128
Mean Seats:  325.667  286.750  11.417
effective parties:   2.518
Lambda set to zero on votes variable: CONSV
Total Seats (avg,min,max):  623.833  609.000  630.000
Taagerpera's index (avg,min,max):  2.711  2.656  2.785

This example excludes the "other" party, but includes the Conservative, Labour,
and Liberal Parties.  A single estimate for rho (the electoral responsiveness
parameter) appears (1.018349) and its standard error (0.080672), along with the
lambdas (partisan bias parameters) and their standard errors for the second and
third parties included in this run.

In addition to these basic results, other information appears at the end.  The
dependent variables are listed, along with their corresponding proportions of
votes and numbers of seats.  The average "effective number of parties" is
reported.  The antipenultimate line of output gives the name of the reference
party for which lambda is set to zero.  The average, minimum, and maximum
numbers of total legislative seats and the value of Taagepera's index appear in
the final two lines.
