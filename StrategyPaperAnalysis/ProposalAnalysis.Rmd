Description: This notebook file was created by A. Trelles on 12/28/19 as part of the Strategy Paper.

#General Description:
This analysis is used as a reference to write the code for the analysis of partisan counterporposals for the 2013 and 2017 redistricting process in relation with partisan ruling status, its strenght (vote returns), and state level coalition dynamics.  

The first part of the ProposalAnalysis.Rmd IS NOT CODE. It describes the general objectives of the analysis based on the hypotheses derived from the paper and the available data we have to test them. In all cases, the DV is related to a partyÂ´s decision to formulate a counterporposal. 

General Hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 assume the DV is if a party formulated a counterporposal,
and vary according the ruling party (H1), party strenght/vote returns (H2), and coalitions (H3).

Generate data frame for testing entry decisions.

Data frame: ys.proposed

Main unit of analysis: (party BY state AND year) -- summarize the actions each party took for each state in year -- NOT individual proposals

Measures (aggregated by STATE and YEAR )

- numproposals - number of proposals made by  party
- didPropose -  logical - whether party made any propoals -dummy variable derived from number of proposals > 0
- didControl - logical - whether party was in sole control of the state for the entire relevant period , derived from (control)
- didRule - logical whether party was in power at the end of the period, while redistricting takes place
- didWinever - party was in control at least once  during the period


State-level measures inherited from controlByWindow()
- partylist, partyseq, partytab, singlecontrol, percentsingle, primary, secondary, tertiary
State-level measures added:
- singlecontrol - dummy, where singlecontrol != NONE
NOTE: these  are measures of the STATE at that time, not specific to party
- partylist - names of parties in control of state over the relevant prior period, names may repeat if party control cycles back and forth
- year_2017 - indicator if year is 2017, based on (year)
- ruleparty - name of party that was in control at last year of period

Strategic Position Categorization

A party in a "strong" position political position in the state, then they are more likely to propose than a party with a less "strong" position.

The decision is a function of several variables such as: party controls the state during the redistricting year, if the party has been the sole ruler over from 1990-2013/17, and if they have ruled a majority of that timer period, if they have ruled at least once during that time period. 

The variables used in the decision tree embody levels of competition in each state. A state controlled by a single party during the period has low levels of political competition, for example. A state with a party which has not won a majority of elections but has won at least once has some degree of power in a competitive state (there are at least two parties competing), as another example. The former has a better "strategic position" than the latter. 

The "Strategic Positions" are defined as follows:
1. Party a) Controls during redistricting year b) has controlled state in all previous observed periods

2. Party a) Controls during redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods

3. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won a MAJORITY of previous elections in observed time period

4. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won a MINORITY of previous elections in observed time period

5.  Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won NONE of the previous elections during the time period

6. Party a) DOES NOT control during the redistricting year b) has NOT controlled state in all previously observed periods c) has won NONE of the previous elections during the time period d) another party has won ALL previous elections

H1.2: Strategic Decision (Party deciides how to play the game based on the Ruling Party at the state level) --> Decision of a political party to participate in redistricting based on degree of alternatioin at the state level.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Hypotheses (stage --> First vs Second Round):
 
#H.1.2.1 Parties are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) during the first round. --> 

#THEORY:The theory behind this hypothesis is that, ceteris paribus, is that parties are more likely to play the game (propose) during the first stage becasue of the first mover advantage (if your counter proposal is selected in the first round it becomes the departing point for the second round) --> We assume that the margin of change from the first to the second scenario is larger than the margin of change between the second and third scenario (this assumption can be tested with Cox and Katz's difference similarity index). 

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made in the first vs second stage in 2013 and 2014; b) Breakdown of proposals made in the first vs second stage by party in 2013 and 2014; and c) Breakdown of proposals made in the first vs second stage by state in 2013 and 2014; b) Breakdown of proposals made in the first vs second stage by party and state in 2013 and 2014. 

=====

#H.1.2.2 Parties ruling a state under single party dominance, are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) during the first round, than all other opposition parties. 

#THEORY:The theory behind this hypothesis is that, ceteris paribus, dominant parties have more vested interests and will be more likely to engage in the first state than smaller and non-competitive parties. 

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made in the first vs second stage in 2013 and 2014 controling for strategic position and major vs minor parties;

====

#H.1.2.3 Parties that are secondary or terciary forces at the state level, are more likely to participate in redistricting (formulate a counterproposal) during the first round, than smaller opposition parties.

#THEORY: The theory behind this hypothesis is that, ceteris paribus, parties that are competing for power are more likely to engage in the first state than smaller and non-competitive parties. 

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made in the first vs second stage in 2013 and 2014 controling for strategic position and major vs minor parties;

===

#1.2.4 As alternation in power/competition increases at the state level, the number of counterporposals in the second stage will be higher compared to states dominated by a single party.

#THEORY:The theory behind this hypothesis is that, ceteris paribus, as competition increases, parties that are competing for power are more likely to engage in the process in the second stage. 

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made in the first vs second stage in 2013 and 2014 controling for strategic position and major vs minor parties;

Hypotheses (level --> CLV (Local) vs CNV(National):

#H.1.2.5 (centralization/coordination hypothesis) We would expect the CNV to have the upper hand and formulate more proposals in both processes. 

#THEORY:Despite parties can engage both at the local and national level, the redistricting process and the TC session in the main headquarters, which is where the CNV is based. Furthermore, the CNV has a more direct connection with the parties' headquarters in Mexico City (CEN). 

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals mad in the CNV and CLV. 

#H.1.2.6 (Novelty/Learning to play the game) We expect more proposals by the CNV in 2013 than in 2017. 

#THEORY: We expect that given that online interaction was new in 2013, the CNV would be more proactive that year. 
#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals mad in the CNV and CLV in 2013 and 2017. 

#H.1.2.7 As alternation in power/competition increases at the state level, parties are more likely to formulate a counterproposal at the local level (CLV)

#THEORY:The theory behind this hypothesis is that  the national headquarters of a party (CNV) are going to be more interested in engaging in those state where the party has a stronghold or is competitive. As competition increases across states, we expect to see smaller parties engaging more at the local level (CLV)

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made in the CNV vs CLV in 2013 and 2014 controling for strategic position and major vs minor parties;

Hypotheses (Process --> 2013 vs 2017):

#H.1.2.8 We expect to observe more proposals in 2013 than in 2017

#THEORY: Parties are more likely to formulate a counterproposal in because the two levels were more proactive 2013, less precise, and the algorithm was less efficent (allowed greater margin of change). 

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made in 2013 and 2014

#3.1.2 Larger Parties (PRI, PAN or PRD) not ruling the state are more likely to engage in the process via a coaliton.  

#THEORY: Larger parties will try to engage the process by making a coalition with smaller parties.  

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made by non-ruling larger parties in coalition vs non-rulling larger parties racing alone in 2013 and 2017.

MAJOR PARTIES

```

Variables
#DV: Dummy variable capturing if party formulated a proposal (PROPOSED: True or False, by Sate, by round, by year).
#IV(1): Dummy variable captruing if a party competed under a coalition before redisrticting took place. 

#3.1.3 (Extension and competitiveness) #Smaller parties (not PRI, PAN or PRD) that have a strong and successful coalition with a larger party, are more likely  to formulate a similar counter proposal to its larger coalition mate than smaller parties that competed separately.  

#THEORY: As the coalitions extension and stength increases, parties in the coalition are more likely to engage. 

#DIAGNOSTICS: a) Breakdown of proposals made by parties proposing in coalition based on the level of high extension and competitivness(DUMMY WHERE E>.5 AND C>.5 = 1, Otherwise 0). 

#3.1.3 (Check Matching Proposals): If parties are run in coalition, we expect that they will have matching scores in proposals. 

#THEORY Parties competing together in a coalition should formulate the same plan. 
Matching Process (Practice)
```{r}
#0.1 Coalition hypothesis: If a coalition was formed, Did the plan of minor party(ies) match the score of the major party? --> This is just for verifying our assumption (robustness check). 

## Joining coalition dataset to the full proposal dataset
matching.df.coal <- propfull.df %>% left_join(coalitions.df, by=c("edon", "year", "actor"))

## Filters out 1st and 2nd stage proposals and parties that PROPOSED.
##Parties in the coalitions may not propose even when the coalition proposes -- still want to capture minor parties who do not propose on their own
#Two majors w/ diff scores, two minors w different scores

####STAGES
#Stage 2 = Stage 1
#Stage 4 = Stage 2
#the other stages capture other score related data

#0.2 The EMB/Algorithm should be treated as an "actor" in the game (and in the analysis of #1 and #2 below), where the scroe associated to the FIRST SCENARIO should be treated as its own plan. If this plans prevails across the two stages --> EMB/Algorithm wins

#0.3 Level of Engagement.This measure captures the degree of intensity of partisan engagment in the process by year. In general, we think of engagment as an ordinal variable, where the minimum level of partisan engagment in a given year is 0 (a party does not formulate a counterproposal in a state at any stage or level) and the maximum degree of engagment is 4 (a party fomulates a counterproposal in two stages and at the two levels at a given state/year). 

  #0.3.1 Count Measure of engagment --> Code that aggregates the level of engagment by parties for every           state/year. Possible categories: i. Parties at the minimum do not engage at all in the process for a given       state/year (0), ii. Parties formulated only one proposal (regardles of the stage and level), iii. Parties        formulates two proposals (regardles of the stage and level), iv.Parties formulated three proposals (regardles    of the stage and level), and v. Parties formulated four proposals (regardles of the stage and level). 

  #0.3.2 Descriptive level of engagment by party  --> Code for generating tables and visualizations that           aggregate proposals by party at the year, stage, and level. 

  #0.3.3 Descriptive level of engagment by party and state  --> Code for generating tables and visualizations      that aggregate proposals by party at the year, stage, and level.

#1.Efficiency hypothesis (Part 1: lowest score): RQ: Which party/parties were more effective in formulating plans with the lowest cost? --> We theorize that 1) major parties will be more efficient than smaller ones, 2) that PAN, at least in 2013 and at the national level, was the most efficent party because of its level of professionalization, and 3) that because of algorithm efficeny and learning experience, 3.1) PAN became less efficient between 2013 and 2017, and 3.2) other parties performed better between years and levels.

#2. Efficiency hypothesis (Part 2: winning proposals) RQ: Which party/parties were more effective in formulating plans that were accepted by the TC/EMB? --> Again (same as #1, but evaluated with a different measure), we theorize that [[1. DID THE PARTY "WIN" & 2. DID THEY WIN WITH MINSCORE?]]

#1) major parties will be more efficient than smaller ones,
#2) that PAN, at least in 2013 and at the national level, was the most efficent party because of its level of professionalization,

Hypothesis:
# If a state is dominated by a single party prior the redistricting process, the ruling party in that state is more likely to formulate a counterproposal than any other party. 

Variables: 
#DV: Dummy variable capturing if party formulated a proposal (PROPOSED: True or False, by Sate, by round, by year).

#IV(1): Dummy variable captruing if a single party ruled that state before redisrticting took place (single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State). 

#IV(2): Categorical variable captruing the degree of alternation in power (six categories from a non-competitive state to a party that has multiparty comptetion and alternation has taken place >3+ times in the 00-17 period): 1) single_pty_dom_00_17:True or False, by State; 2) alt_power1_00_17; 3) alt_power2_00_17; 4) alt_power2_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17; 5) alt_power3_00_17; 6) alt_power3_00_17 x multi_comp_00_17. 

Method:
#To test H1.1: chi.sq test.
