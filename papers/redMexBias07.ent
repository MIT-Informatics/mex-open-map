macro:->Other
elements
highlighted
by

our

partisan
bias
ignores
are
the
cube-law's
bonus,
large
third-party
votes,
and
possible
interactions
between
all
the
elements.
The
bonus
is,
in
fact,
captured
by
the
system's
responsiveness
parameter
and
therefore
distinct
from
partisan
bias
in
our
framework
(more

We

macro:->Compensating
\emph
{parties}
bears
relation
to,
but
is
not
the
same
as,
compensating
\emph
{citizens}
of
over-populated

Keeping
these
compensations
distinct
is
important.
Much
of
the
evidence
presented
here,
as
in
the
scholarly
literature,
deals
with
party
votes
to
seats
ratios.
From
the
normative
standpoint,
however,
it
is
the
`one
person,
one
vote'
principle---one
of
Dahl's
\citeyearpar
{dahl.1972}
preconditions
of
democratic
government---that
malapportionment
antagonizes,
and
party
compensation
is
not
designed
to
redress
this
imbalance.
The
exception
would
be
a
system
with
perfectly
district-based
parties,
where
measures
to
achieve
party
proportionality
are,
in
fact,
compensations
for
the
district
citizenry
only.
Shifts
away
from
fully
local
parties,
towards
party
nationalization,
and
party
compensation
stop
accruing
to
citizens
of
the
underrepresented
districts
only.

{Secciones

Median

median

The
1997,
2006,

2015
maps
(kindly
shared
by
IFE's
cartography
department)
relate
more
than
sixty-six
thousand
secciones,
the
basic
units
for

to
300

Population

Performing
linear

preferable
(because
they

a

minority

In

however,
there

primordial

between
contiguous,
and
possibly
antagonistic
indigenous
communities---all
fall
in
the
`indigenous'
category,
and
are
grouped
in
one
congressional
district
\citep
{sonnleitner.elsCps2012}.
The
case
of
Arizona's
Hopi
and
Navajo
tribes
is
an
example
where
a
redistricting
authority
made
a
concious
effort
to
segregate
antagonistic
tribes
