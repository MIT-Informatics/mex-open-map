Preparing the Vote Share Data
```{r}
#FIX: All of this data prep code should be in its own file (e.g. PlanElectionScores.R) 
#     The separate file should take as input the propfull.df generated by prepdata
#     It should either produce a scoring function as per planScoreFunctions.R or produce a tibble with one column of planid and the other of various score vectors
#      the  only things that should be included in theTransparencyAnalysis directly are :
# - source("PlanElectionScores.R")
# - joining the scores to planProp.df
# - the specific analysis of  the partisan consequences of Rules violations & section 8
# - Any  analyses for the strategy paper should go in the replication file for that paper
