1) the placement of Figure 2 in the text (I think it is a bit distracting for the reader) should be a couple of paragraphs ahead of where it is.

2) part of our discussion of the PRI-Green coalition that is directly in the text can be moved as the first paragraph of footnote 10. I know this is a response to a reviewer's concern, but it can be a bit distracting for the non-Mexican specialist.

Three fine tuning suggestions:

- In item 5, rather than starting the reply by defending the approach, can we frame it as a miscommunication about the scope of the analysis, and add a couple of lines to "clarify", before moving to the defensive text... 
- In item 10 of the response, we end with: "We could alternatively report 95-percent CIs around predicted seat shares: these would require more ex- planation than standard SEs, so we prefer the latter. We have added a section in the on-line appendix elaborating this point." Would it be possible to simpler to say we've included  the CI's in the online appendix, rather than explaining why we don't?
- We could name the repository in which the data will be shared. Dataverse is a reasonable place and I have a dataverse instance set up here we can use, if you like:
